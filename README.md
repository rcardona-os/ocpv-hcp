## Prerequisites

- [x] OCP v4.17

- [x] ODF Installed and configure (default block storage class)

- [x] OCP Virtualization installed and configured


## Steps:

#### 0 - Installing Muticluster operator

##### 0.1 - Make sure the OCP cluster has wildcard DNS routes enabled
```bash
$ oc patch ingresscontroller default -n openshift-ingress-operator \
  --type=json \
  -p '[
    { 
      "op": "add", 
      "path": "/spec/routeAdmission", 
      "value": { 
        "wildcardPolicy": "WildcardsAllowed" 
      } 
    }
  ]'
```

##### 0.2 - The OpenShift Container Platform management cluster has a default storage class
```bash
$ oc patch storageclass ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd \
  -p '{
    "metadata": {
      "annotations": {
        "storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class": "true"
      }
    }
  }'
```

##### 0.3 - Install *"Multicluster Engine for Kubernetes"* Operator

```bash
$ oc create namespace multicluster-engine
```

```bash
$ oc project multicluster-engine
```

```bash
$ oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: multicluster-engine-operators
  namespace: multicluster-engine
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - multicluster-engine
EOF
```

```bash
$ oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: multicluster-engine
  namespace: multicluster-engine
spec:
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  source: redhat-operators
  channel: stable-2.7
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: multicluster-engine
EOF
```

```bash
$ oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: multicluster.openshift.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterEngine
metadata:
  name: multiclusterengine
spec: {}
EOF
```
NOTE: If this step fails with the following error, the resources are still being created and applied. Run the command again in a few minutes when the resources are created

```text
error: unable to recognize "./mce.yaml": no matches for kind "MultiClusterEngine" in version "operator.multicluster-engine.io/v1"
```

- Run the following command to get the custom resource. It can take up to 10 minutes for the MultiClusterEngine custom resource status to display as Available in the status.phase field after you run the following command:

```bash
$ oc get -o json mce multiclusterengine | jq -r '.status.phase'
```

##### 0.4 - Test if the multicluster engine Operator has at least one managed OCP cluster
üöÄ  A managed cluster is any cluster that is centrally managed by a control plane, such as Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM), OpenShift GitOps, or OpenShift Hosted Control Planes. A key Characteristics of a Managed Cluster is that it can be a full OpenShift cluster or a hosted cluster.

```bash
$ oc get managedclusters local-cluster
```

####  1 - installing hcp cli
##### 1.0 - Get the URL to download the hcp binary by running the following command:
```bash
$ oc get ConsoleCLIDownload hcp-cli-download -o json | jq -r ".spec"
```

##### 1.2 - Download the hcp binary by running the following command:
```bash
$ wget <hcp_cli_download_url> 
Replace hcp_cli_download_url with the URL that you obtained from the previous step.
```
e.i.

```bash
$ wget https://hcp-cli-download-multicluster-engine.apps.ov.sandbox2941.opentlc.com/darwin/amd64/hcp.tar.gz \
  --no-check-certificate
```

##### 1.3 - Unpack the downloaded archive by running the following command:
```bash
$ tar xvzf hcp.tar.gz
```

##### 1.4 - Make the hcp binary file executable by running the following command:
```bash
$ chmod +x hcp
```

##### 1.5 - Move the hcp binary file to a directory in your path by running the following command:
```bash
$ sudo mv hcp /usr/local/bin/.
```

üí° If you download the CLI on a Mac computer, you might see a warning about the hcp binary file. You need to adjust your security settings to allow the binary file to be run.

##### 1.6 - Verification (platform: aws, kubevirt, etc)
```bash
$ hcp create cluster <platform> --help 
```

#### 2 - provisioning a hosted cluster
##### 2.0 - provisioning hosted cluster
üöÄ Along the guest cluster named **guest-cluster-0**, a namespace named **hcp** is being created 
```bash
$ hcp create cluster kubevirt \
  --name guest-cluster-0 \
  --namespace hcp \
  --node-pool-replicas 3 \
  --pull-secret pull-secret.json \
  --memory 10 \
  --cores 8 \
  --release-image quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.17.0-multi \
  --etcd-storage-class=ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
```

üöÄ Verify that the hosted control plane pods are running with *oc -n clusters-< hosted-cluster-name > get pods*, these are the pods that run the control plane of the managed cluster.
```bash
$ oc get pods -n hpc-guest-cluster-0 
```

##### 2.1 - To check the status of the hosted cluster

## üöÄ Namespace Breakdown in OpenShift HCP (Hypershift)

| Namespace                 | What It Represents |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| **`hcp`**                 | **The Management Cluster's HCP Namespace** ‚Üí This is where OpenShift **manages** the Hosted Control Plane (HCP) for your hosted cluster. |
| **`hcp-guest-cluster-0`** | **The Hosted Cluster's Namespace** ‚Üí This is where your worker nodes, workloads, and control plane components live **inside the hosted cluster**. |

---

## üåç Where Each Component Runs

| **Component**             | **Lives In Namespace**          | **Where It Runs** |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Hosted Control Plane**  | `hcp` (Management Cluster)     | **Management Cluster** |
| **Worker Nodes (VMs)**    | `hcp-guest-cluster-0`         | **Hosted Cluster** |
| **MachinePool / NodePool** | `hcp` (Management Cluster)    | **Controls Hosted Cluster Workers** |
| **KubeVirt VMs**          | `hcp-guest-cluster-0`         | **Hosted Cluster Worker Nodes** |

---

## üîç Verifying Each Namespace

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Hosted Control Plane (`hcp`) ‚Äì The Management Side**
To list all resources **inside the management cluster** (Hosting Cluster):
```sh
oc get all -n hcp


üöÄ A hosted cluster is a cluster that only runs worker nodes, its control plane and API endpoint hosted on a management cluster.

```bash
$ oc get hostedclusters -n hcp
```

#### 3 - Accessing the hosted cluster

##### 3.0 - Generating the kubeconfig file
```bash
$ hcp create kubeconfig \
  --namespace <HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAMESPACE> \
  --name <HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME> > <HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME>.kubeconfig
``` 





##### adding identity provider
```bash
$ oc edit HostedCluster guest-cluster-0 -n hcp
```

#### extracting the hosted cluster credentials

- kubeconfig
```bash
$ hcp create kubeconfig \
  --namespace hcp \
  --name guest-cluster-0 > guest-cluster.kubeconfig
```

```bash
$ oc --kubeconfig guest-cluster.kubeconfig get nodes
```

- the secret in the 
```bash
oc get -o json secret kubeadmin-password -n hcp-guest-cluster-0 | jq -r 
```
